Encapsulation tutorial: due tonight
Properties tutorial: due Tuesday
Milestone 1: due Friday

----------------------------

Properties vs fields.


public int Number;


//what kind of property is this?
public int Number {get; set;}


--> make an equivalent property without the above shortcut


--> visibility -- how to make Number only modifiable inside the class?


--> default values -- how to make Number start at 10?


--> how to set a default value if there is a backing field?



--> lambda syntax (expression-bodied member) =>

private int _number = 10;
public int Number
{
    get => _number;
    set => _number = value;
}

public string GetString() => First + " " + Last;


See LabRoom class. Turn fields into properties.
--> enforce room size 10-30
--> make Windows value get-only (except on creation)
    1) using a constructor
    2) using init

----------------------------

Common mistake with properties:

public int Property
{
    get
    {
        return Property;
    }
    set
    {
        Property = value;
    }
}

int val = obj.Property;



----------------------------

struct vs class

differences in memory


when to use each


--> how to make PointStruct immutable?

----------------------------

static vs non-static: associated with a class and not a particular object

when to use each?

what would a static field or property mean?

--> what if we wanted a consistent drinks policy (yes/no) across all
    lab rooms?

--> static constructor

---------------------------------------------

Encapsulation - what is this?
