Encapsulation tutorial: due tonight
Properties tutorial: due Tuesday
Milestone 1: due Friday (you might notice the design is ugly...)

--> git should be installed on the lab machines now

----------------------------

Properties vs fields.



--> autoproperty

--> visibility

--> default values

--> enforcing bounds

--> lambda notation




---------------------------


See LabRoom class. Turn fields into properties.
--> enforce room size 10-30
--> make Windows value get-only (except on creation)
    1) using a constructor
    2) using init

----------------------------

Common mistake with properties:

public int Property
{
    get
    {
        return Property;
    }
    set
    {
        Property = value;
    }
}

int val = obj.Property;



----------------------------
see PointStruct, try to use.



--> differences between class and struct?


--> how to make PointStruct immutable?


--> why should structs usually be immutable?



----------------------------

static vs non-static.

    --> when can/should a field/method/property be static?
    --> when is a field/method/property NOT allowed to be static?
    --> when should a class be static?

--> can a static class have a constructor?

--> can a non-static class have a static constructor?


--> what if we wanted a consistent drinks policy (yes/no) across all
    lab rooms?


--> how could we initialize the drink policy for everyone?


--> how could we modify the drinks policy for everyone?


---------------------------------------------

Encapsulation - what is this?


Want to keep track of scores and majors for students.
    --> see current organization
    --> why not great?
    --> how to improve?
