Encapsulation tutorial: due tonight
Properties tutorial: due Tuesday
Milestone 1: due Friday (you might notice the design is ugly...)

--> make sure your project builds (but it won't run)

--> save your files!

--> how to check what you submitted?

--> what if you need to re-release? v0.0.1

--> "you are ahead of branch main..."

--> git should be installed on the lab machines now

----------------------------

Properties vs fields.

public int Num;

public int Num {get; set;}


have more control over visibility (esp when setting)


--> autoproperty

public int Num {get; set;}

is equivalent to:

private int _num = 10;
public int Num
{
    get
    {
        return _num;
    }
    set
    {
        _num = value;
    }
}

--> visibility

--> default values

public int Num {get; set;} = 10;



or initialize in the constructor:

public WhateverClass()
{
    Num = 10;
}


--> lambda notation =>

private int _num = 10;
public int Num
{
    get => _num;
    set => _num = value;
}


obj.Num = 10;


public string GetString() => First + " " + Last;
 

public string Name => "Club Sub"; 

---------------------------

Common mistake with properties:

public int Property
{
    get
    {
        return Property;
    }
    set
    {
        Property = value;
    }
}

obj.Property;


----------------------------


See LabRoom class. Turn fields into properties.
--> enforce room size 10-30
--> make Windows value get-only (except on creation)
    1) using a constructor
    2) using init


------------------------------

see PointStruct, try to use.



--> differences between class and struct?


--> how to make PointStruct immutable?


--> why should structs usually be immutable?



----------------------------

<-- stopped here for 2:30 section, did a little with
    static (stopped before static constructors) in 1:30 section

----------------------------

static vs non-static.

    --> when can/should a field/method/property be static?
    --> when is a field/method/property NOT allowed to be static?
    --> when should a class be static?

--> can a static class have a constructor?

--> can a non-static class have a static constructor?


--> what if we wanted a consistent drinks policy (yes/no) across all
    lab rooms?


--> how could we initialize the drink policy for everyone?


--> how could we modify the drinks policy for everyone?


---------------------------------------------

Encapsulation - what is this?


Want to keep track of scores and majors for students.
    --> see current organization
    --> why not great?
    --> how to improve?
