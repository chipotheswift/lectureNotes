- Milestone 0 due Friday, August 23
    --> will discuss today
    --> can get help today and Friday in class

- The week 2 module will be automatically available on Friday, August 23
    --> two tutorials (due next Mon and Tues)
    --> Milestone 1 (due next Fri)

//////////////////////

Today:

- A little more C# review
- Using git from the terminal
- Branches, merging 
- Start Milestone 0

///////////////////////////

Consider the following Person class:

public class Person {
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
 

Create two Person objects â€“ pers1 and pers2. 
    pers1: John Doe, age 40
    pers2: Maria Smith, age 20.

Person pers1 = new Person() {Name = "John Doe", Age = 40};
Person pers2 = new Person() {Name = "Maria Smith", Age = 20};



(Different ways to create / set name and age?)


What if we do:
    Console.WriteLine(pers1);


/////

If we do:

pers1 = pers2; //no reference to John anymore, will get garbage collected
pers1.Age++;
Console.WriteLine(pers1.Age);
Console.WriteLine(pers2.Age);

What prints?


////////////////////////

Overall idea of git.

- have a remote repository (this is the URL you copy before you clone)
- can have one or many local repositories on different computers
    - each local repository is connected to the remote repository
    - the remote repository is the "origin"
    - each local repository will have a pointer to an active branch ("HEAD")
    
--> different local repositories might have different "HEAD" values

--> as you checkout different branches in your local repo, the code on the computer
    will change. This does NOT mean you've lost your other code.

--> if you made changes to a local branch, you must make a commit and PUSH it
    to the corresponding remote branch

--> if there are changes in a remote branch, you must PULL them into 
    the corresponding local branch

////////////////

Example: see branching of lectureNotes repo


////////////////

When you sit down to work:

    git status

--> see what branch you are on
--> see if you have any local changes (commit them if you do and want to keep them)


Pull changes from the corresponding remote branch:

    git pull

(will need to set upstream in configurations initially. Can also do:
git pull origin <branchName>)


(git pull only pulls from the current branch. Will need to separately pull
or checkout other branches, if needed.)

To get ALL remote branches:

    git fetch origin

Then you can checkout the desired branch and pull in from the remote

///////////////

When you take a break, commit and push changes to current branch:

    git add .
    git commit -m "describe your changes"
    git push

(will need to set upstream in configurations initially. Can also do:

    git push -u origin <branchName>

the -u creates a new remote branch with the same if that branch is new. Isn't
needed if the branch already exists, but doesn't hurt.)


/////////////

Other tips:

- commit and push a LOT!
- stay on a milestone branch until you are completely done. Only then do
    you want to merge it into main

////////////

Work through Milestone 0.

- clone the repo to Visual Studio
- use terminal:
    git status
    git branch ms0
    git checkout ms0
    git status

- add comment line to top

--> fix Calories
    (subtract off ingredient amounts)
    e.g., Chicken is 150 calories

--> fix PreparationInformation
    (add "Hold <ToppingName>" for excluded toppings)


In terminal:
    git status
    git add .
    git commit -m "finished milestone 0"
    git push

        (may have upstream issues)

    git status


Now merge into main:
    git checkout main
    git status
    git merge ms0
    git push

--> check remote repo for ms0, main changes
